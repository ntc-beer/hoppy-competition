The Texas Redcoat Challenge is a specialty homebrew competition focused on British beer styles and sponsored by the Denton County Homebrewers Guild. The Texas Redcoat Challenge is unique in that the BJCP styles of beers recognized as "British" in origin or inspiration are the focus, rather than just being grouped as part of the overall field of competition. We want to bring these beers back to the forefront and showcase the original American brewing tradition, helping to shine a light on these fantastic beers, the history behind them, and the brewers crafting them.
